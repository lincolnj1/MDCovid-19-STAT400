# MDCovid-19-STAT400
Final team project for Applied Statistics and Probability at UMD during the Fall 2021 term. This features the code and data sets that I contributed to my team, as well as the Covid data set we worked with. The file maryland-counties.csv is all the Maryland county case data pulled from the New York Times data set, up until December 2020
